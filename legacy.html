Initially, the activities of the organization were limited and only some youths prepared for different competitions collectively.</p><p>Their objective was to fare well in competitive examinations and get good jobs. This had begun in 1994.</p><p>Every Sunday the boys and girls would sit together, organize quiz, debates and mock interviews.</p><p>The founder members of the organization also started showing interest in social activities slowly. They wanted to develop their own personality as well as rapid social development in their area.</p><p>Finally on January 12, 1996, to mark the National Youth Day, members including M Rajiv, Arbind Tiwary, Sandip Sinha, Tushar Kant Mandal, Mamta Kumari, Barnali Chakraborty, Rajendra Prasad, Dilip Kumar and Arun Kumar formed a social organization and named it Youth Unity for Voluntary Action(YUVa).</p><p>Some members of the organization got good government and private jobs thanks to elaborate preparations for competitive examinations.</p><p>This encouraged other youths of the area to join the organization and they too started evincing interest in social activities.</p><p>In the beginning all the members donated Rs 10 every month to subscribe to different magazines and journals and thus founded a library of sorts.</p><p>Later, the Information Department of Tata Steel, headed by venerated Mr C Ramaswamy, too chipped in with a lot of contribution to the library. Today the library run by the organization in a Makdampur is a rich one and running smoothly.</p><p>This organization had been working more in the area of education in its initial years.</p><p>In the meantime a member of the organization Prafulla Tanti died of diarrhea just because he could not be taken to hospital on time.</p><p>This shocked the members of YUVA and they decided to also focus on the area of health in their area of work.</p><p>The eminent entrepreneur of Jamshedpur, Bailey Bodhanwala was impressed by the commitment and social activities of the organization.</p><p>With his help, finally, YUVA, launched a maternity and child welfare centre at makdampur with the technical help from Family Welfare Department of Tisco and Bailey Bodhanwala agreed to head the centre as its convener.</p><p>During all this “YUVA” members were gaining in experience and encountering the dismal situation prevailing in the rural and urban areas.</p><p>They realized that more help is needed in the adjoining rural areas. YUVA members launched initiatives for micro-planning and formation of self-help groups in Gitilata and Naga villages of Potka block of East Singhbhum and solved several development related problems of these villages.</p><p>For further and any specific information please <a href="https://www.yuvajamshedpur.com/contact-us/">contact us!</a></p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 9, 2021</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyuvajamshedpur.com%2Flegacy.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyuvajamshedpur.com%2Flegacy.html&amp;via=%40yuvajsr&amp;text=Legacy" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Legacy https%3A%2F%2Fyuvajamshedpur.com%2Flegacy.html" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/authors/yuvajamshedpur/" class="invert" title="yuvajamshedpur">yuvajamshedpur</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/magsaysay-award-winner-deep-joshi-visits-yuva-project-area-2.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Magsaysay Award winner Deep Joshi visits Yuva project area</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/programs.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Programs</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://facebook.com/yuvajamshedpur" aria-label="Facebook" class="facebook"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/yuvajsr" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Site designed and maintained by <a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Yuva Jamshedpur Team</a></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
