Love does not have any vision in his right eye while the two others have blurred vision in both eyes,” said Narayan, adding that all three were suffering from nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamin A for a long period, which in future would further hamper their vision.”</em></p><p align="left">Yuva Jamshedpur secretary Barnali later met the District welfare officer Mr. Barla and requested him to help. Mr. Barla has sought a report from MGM hospital superintendent S.S. Prasad and arranged for a free check-up of the children at Kashyap Memorial Eye Hospital in Ranchi.</p><p align="left">He told <strong>The Telegraph</strong>: <em>"We will arrange their operation and treatment at the hospital.”</em></p><p align="left">Barla also wrote a letter to BDO Raj and the district special officer (rationing), seeking a report on the exact status of the food security scheme in Potka.</p><p align="left">A Yuva member took the three children to Kashyap Hospital in Ranchi. They were seen by the doctor there.</p><p align="left">Another child Niranjan, however, is still admitted in MGM Hospital. He was scheduled to be operated upon. Doctors prescribed some more tests. But till date he has not been operated upon. It is not certain if the doctors here would conduct the operation as they have been describing his condition as bad and may require expert and specialized treatment.</p><p align="left">Yuva plans to get in touch with Shankar Netralaya doctors very soon to seek their opinion about the condition of the children. Please watch this space for latest update.</p><p align="left">As Sabars are an endangered tribe, the local media took notice of the children's plight. Their interest and questions helped the children's cause in a big way. We hope to see these children get their eyesight back.
