After all, there are so many extraneous factors controlling the circumstances of their life.<br></p><p>The reason cited for the absence of those four children was very simple for most Savars, though it may sound shocking to others. Three girls have gone to the forest with their parents. No guess should be made as to when they would return. The children would return when their parents return. It may take a few days.</p><p>But, the reason for the absence of fourth child, Kuni Savar, was really very shocking for me. She did not come to school because she has been married off to someone. At the age of 9.</p><figure class="size-medium wp-image-735"><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/2011/06/15/one-married-at-9-three-gone-to-forest-with-parents/dsc_0032/" rel="attachment wp-att-735"><img loading="lazy" style="border:1px solid black;margin:5px;" title="DSC_0032" src="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/75/dsc_0032.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/75/responsive/dsc_0032-xs.jpg 300w, https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/75/responsive/dsc_0032-sm.jpg 480w, https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/75/responsive/dsc_0032-md.jpg 768w" alt="Savar Children studying in Kislay - a school for Savar children run by Yuva, Jamshedpur and Asha for Education" width="300" height="200"></a></figure><p></p><p>Well, this does happen in Savar community. Many children are indeed married at a tender age. While, the rest of India thinks that it is a social evil and an unlawful act, Savars hardly know anything about social evils and laws that govern the rest of us. They just don't care. Because, they are just not aware.</p><p>In fact, Puja, another Savar girl attending classes in Kislay regularly, has also been married. But, she has not been sent to her husband's house, yet. And we have been able to persuade her parents to allow her to attend our school regularly. She is a bright girl and is attending the classes enthusiastically.</p><p>Our only hope is that we will also be able to convince the parents of Kuni Savar and her in-laws to allow her to remain in her native village and attend the school regularly.</p><p>For the three girls who have gone to the forests, they would return with their parents.</p><figure class="size-medium wp-image-734"><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/2011/06/15/one-married-at-9-three-gone-to-forest-with-parents/dsc_0039/" rel="attachment wp-att-734"><img loading="lazy" style="border:1px solid black;margin:5px;" title="DSC_0039" src="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/75/dsc_0039.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/75/responsive/dsc_0039-xs.jpg 300w, https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/75/responsive/dsc_0039-sm.jpg 480w, https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/75/responsive/dsc_0039-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></figure><p></p><p>And as far as Kuni Savar, the girl who got married yesterday, is concerned, she just does not know what big change has taken place in her life. Her parents were  drunk and happy. In fact, the entire community gets drunk on hooch and spends most of its earnings from wood-selling on hooch. Others, from outside their community, do make money by selling hooch to them.</p><p>Savars are one of the endangered tribes of India. They remain isolated. It seems that even the government prefers not to disturb them much. And this seems to be a good social policy for them, at least for now.</p><p>We,  too, do not want to disturb their life too much. We only want Savar children to join mainstream of education. Kislay is a step towards that end. We believe only education can bring about positive changes in Savar community.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Related posts:</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/" target="_blank">Yuva Jamshedpur | See the difference!</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/category/programs/savar-education-project/" target="_blank">Savar Education Project | Yuva Jamshedpur</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/2011/01/17/yuva-celebrates-15th-anniversary-2/" target="_blank">Yuva Celebrates 15th Anniversary | Yuva Jamshedpur</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/2011/05/" target="_blank">May | 2011 | Yuva Jamshedpur</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/2011/04/" target="_blank">April | 2011 | Yuva Jamshedpur</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/category/news/programs-news/" target="_blank">Programs-news | Yuva Jamshedpur</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/author/yuvajamshedpur/" target="_blank">Author Archives: yuvajamshedpur - yuvajamshedpur | Yuva Jamshedpur</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/category/news/" target="_blank">News | Yuva Jamshedpur</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 9, 2021</p><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/tags/child-marriage/">child marriage</a></li><li><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/tags/kuni-savar/">Kuni Savar</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyuvajamshedpur.com%2Fone-married-at-9-three-gone-to-forest-with-parents.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyuvajamshedpur.com%2Fone-married-at-9-three-gone-to-forest-with-parents.html&amp;via=%40yuvajsr&amp;text=One%20married%20at%209%2C%20three%20gone%20to%20forest%20with%20parents" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=One%20married%20at%209%2C%20three%20gone%20to%20forest%20with%20parents https%3A%2F%2Fyuvajamshedpur.com%2Fone-married-at-9-three-gone-to-forest-with-parents.html" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/authors/yuvajamshedpur/" class="invert" title="yuvajamshedpur">yuvajamshedpur</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/who-will-protect-child-and-educational-rights-of-puja-savar-and-surmi-savar.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Who will protect child and educational rights of Puja Savar and Surmi Savar?</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/ratani-and-lakhan-too-have-turned-into-dhangars.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Ratani and Lakhan too have turned into Dhangars</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="comments post__inner" id="comments"><h3 class="h5">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
