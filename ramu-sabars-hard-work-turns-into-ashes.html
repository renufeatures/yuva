Accident? Or some clever trick by someone? No one knows. But, the sudden turn of events have left Ramu Sabar, a resident of Tangrain village into a deep lurch. He has lost all that was supposed to support his and his family's life.</p><p lang="en-US">Ramu Sabar of Tangrain village worked hard as a farmer. He had taken Akshay Munda's land on rent for paddy farming. Akshay Munda too is a resident of the same village. Ram Sabar's hard work bore fruits. He reaped around 50 mounds of paddy crop. He was happy. So were his family members.<br>Ramu Sabar reaped the crop and kept all the produce in his khalihan in front of his house on December 6.  He worked whole day and by 3 p.m. all the produce was brought to his khalihan from the field.</p><p lang="en-US">But, by 3.30 p.m. all his fortune turned into ashes. He lost paddy worth at least Rs. 12 thousand in the fire.</p><p lang="en-US">It is not yet clear whether the fire was caused by accident, or someone set fire on his produce for malicious reasons.</p><p lang="en-US">Sabars are not a farming community. They prefer to live in forests. A lot of efforts are being made by the government and different social organizations to encourage them to join the mainstream and take up farming and other regular professions.</p><p lang="en-US">But, it is really a heart-rending misfortune and setback for a person from Sabar community to have lost everything after such hard work. An accident of this magnitude cannot be compared to anything.  It seems misfortune loves only hard-working, honest and poor persons. This one incident is enough to disprove existence of a super-natural power.</p><p lang="en-US">Is it an coincidence?</p><p lang="en-US">Ramu Sabar was full of enthusiasm and wanted to be a part of the mainstream society.</p><p lang="en-US">It would be very hard for him now to think of taking up farming again. And will he be at fault if he does not take up farming next year?</p><p lang="en-US">Ramu Sabar's two children are studying in a residential school in Patamda with help from Yuva, Jamshedpur.</p><p lang="en-US">Does the government have any policy to help such people from endangered tribal communities?</p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 9,
