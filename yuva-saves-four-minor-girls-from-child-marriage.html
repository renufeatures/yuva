A person from Tangrain village itself reached the hostel and told the hostel administrators that Puja's mother has died. He took Puja Sabar with himself and then got her married with a middle-aged peson from Lango village.</p><p>Yuva Mitra Jayanti Sardar of Chakdi village told other Yuva members about this. With a lot of efforts and persuasion from Yuva secretary Barnali Chakravorty and Arup Kumar Mandal, Puja Sabar was freed from the village and was re-admitted to the hostel in Parsudih.</p><p>After only a few days, it was learnt that another girl from Tangrain village was sold off for Rs. 3,000. It was further learnt that the girl who was sold off was none else but the younger sister of Puja, 8-year-old Milan Sabar.  The father of Puja and Milan Sabar had died some six years back, while their mother had married off and gone somewhere else leaving them as helpless. Another Sabar from the same village was supposed to act as a guardian of these two girls, but he himself had sold them off for marriage to a middle-aged person from Lango village.</p><figure class="wp-image-1558 size-medium"><a href="https://yuvajamshedpur.in/2015/03/25/yuva-saves-four-minor-girls-from-child-marriage/attachment/1558/" rel="attachment wp-att-1558"><img loading="lazy" src="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/144/bari-sabar-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/144/responsive/bari-sabar-1-xs.jpg 300w, https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/144/responsive/bari-sabar-1-sm.jpg 480w, https://yuvajamshedpur.com/media/posts/144/responsive/bari-sabar-1-md.jpg 768w" alt="Bari Sabar (Pix: Uttam Acharjee)" width="300" height="225"></a></figure>Bari Sabar<p></p><p>Thanks to Yuva's intervention, Milan Sabar was saved from child marriage and was brought back.
